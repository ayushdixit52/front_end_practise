            Jerry, a shy but intelligent 4-month-old Lab mix, is a keenly observant and sensitive soul who initially appears nervous. He is a quick study, however, and his introverted nature doesn't prevent him from showing a humorous and playful side, often characterized by a head cock, a tentative approach, and an adorable wiggly walk with erect ears. Jerry is a sweet dog hoping for a patient family who will appreciate his unique and sensitive personality

                A Tom cat, or male cat, is known for its playful and sometimes independent nature. These furry companions, with their sharp claws and keen senses, are skilled hunters of small prey. A cat's sleek body, attentive ears, and gentle purr make it a beloved pet. Though they sleep a lot during the day, Tom cats become active at night, often entertaining themselves by playing with small objects or chasing after toys. They are intelligent, communicate with humans through soft meows, and provide comfort and joy to their families.
